0	PR Title: Improve list scoring logic\\n\\nDescription:\\nWe need to compute the "score" of a list for analytics. Make the scoring correct and efficient.	This PR improves the list scoring logic, addressing correctness and efficiency concerns.  However, the description lacks detail.  Please provide:\\n\\n* **Specifics on the scoring algorithm:**  What changed?  What were the previous shortcomings?  Include a clear description of the new algorithm and its rationale.\\n* **Performance improvements:**  Quantify the efficiency gains (e.g., benchmark results, time complexity analysis).\\n* **Test coverage:**  How was the correctness of the new algorithm validated?  Were unit tests added or existing tests updated?\\n\\nWithout this information, I cannot approve the PR.  Please address these points before resubmitting.	## Review Comments: Improve list scoring logic\\n\\nThis PR needs significant improvements in clarity, correctness, and testability.\\n\\n**Major Concerns:**\\n\\n* **Missing Scoring Logic:** The PR description doesn't define the actual scoring algorithm.  What constitutes a "score"? Is it the count of unique elements? The sum of unique elements? Something else?  The code is needed to understand and review the logic.  Provide a clear mathematical formula or pseudocode describing the score calculation.\\n\\n* **Canonicalization Ambiguity:**  A1 mentions "trim/normalize casing and numeric type".  This is vague. Provide specific examples.  What constitutes "trim"? (leading/trailing whitespace only?  Other characters?)  How is casing normalized (lowercase?  uppercase?)? What about other data types (dates, booleans)? How is canonicalization implemented?  The code needs to clearly show this process.\\n\\n* **Type Stability and -0 Handling:** A2 mentions type-stable comparisons for -0 and 0. This is crucial.  The reviewer needs to see explicit code handling this (e.g., using `math.isclose` or similar for floating-point comparisons).  Demonstrate that the code correctly handles  `-0.0`, `0.0`, `0`, and other numeric types consistently.\\n\\n* **Missing Error Handling:** What happens with invalid input (e.g., non-list input, lists containing non-comparable types)? Add robust error handling and appropriate logging/exceptions.\\n\\n* **Lack of Tests:**  No mention of tests.  This is unacceptable.  Add comprehensive unit tests covering:\\n    * Empty lists.\\n    * Lists with only unique elements.\\n    * Lists with duplicate elements (before and after canonicalization).\\n    * Lists containing negative numbers, zero, and different numeric types.\\n    * Lists containing strings with leading/trailing whitespace and mixed casing.\\n    * Lists with invalid input types (raise appropriate exceptions).\\n    * Edge cases related to type stability and -0 handling.\\n\\n\\n**Specific Code Suggestions:**\\n\\n* **Introduce a `canonicalize` function:**  Extract the canonicalization logic into a separate, well-tested function for better readability and maintainability.  Document the function clearly, including examples.\\n\\n* **Use a `collections.Counter`:** This will efficiently count unique elements after canonicalization.\\n\\n* **Add comments:**  Explain each step of the scoring algorithm in detail.\\n\\n* **Improve variable names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., instead of  `list`, use `input_list`, `unique_elements`, `score`).\\n\\n\\n**Example Code Snippet (Illustrative - replace with actual implementation):**\\n\\n```python\\nimport math\\nfrom collections import Counter\\n\\ndef canonicalize(item):\\n    """Canonicalizes an item by trimming whitespace, lowercasing strings, and handling numeric types."""\\n    if isinstance(item, str):\\n        return item.strip().lower()  #Example - needs refinement per A1\\n    elif isinstance(item, (int, float)):\\n        return 0.0 if math.isclose(item, 0.0) else item #Example - address -0.0\\n    else:  # Add handling for other types or raise an exception\\n        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type: {type(item)}")\\n\\ndef calculate_score(input_list):\\n    """Calculates the score of a list (replace with actual scoring logic)."""\\n    unique_elements = Counter(map(canonicalize, input_list))\\n    # ... scoring logic based on unique_elements ...\\n    return score\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\nThis PR needs substantial rework before merging.  Address these comments and provide more details on the scoring algorithm and testing strategy.
1	PR Title: Better user status\\n\\nDescription:\\nShow a better "active" status for users. It should reflect engagement more accurately.	The PR title is vague.  Please specify *how* user "active" status is improved (e.g., "User active status now reflects last activity timestamp").  The description lacks detail.  Include:\\n\\n* **Specific changes made:**  What code was modified?  What metrics define "engagement"?\\n* **Testing:** What tests were added or updated to cover these changes?\\n* **Examples:** Show before and after screenshots or examples illustrating the improved status.\\n\\nWithout this information, approval cannot be granted.	## Review Comments: Better User Status PR\\n\\nThis PR introduces a significant change to the "active" user status calculation. While the intent is clear, several aspects require clarification and improvement.\\n\\n\\n**Concerns & Action Items:**\\n\\n* **Missing Decay Function:**  A2 mentions a "decay" function for engagement.  The PR must explicitly define this function (e.g., exponential decay, half-life).  Include the formula and implementation in the code.  Without this, the "weighted engagement" calculation is incomplete.\\n\\n* **Threshold Justification:** The threshold of â‰¥ 3 is arbitrary.  Provide a rationale for choosing this value, ideally backed by data or user research. Consider adding a configurable threshold to allow for future adjustments.\\n\\n* **Data Type and Overflow:**  The weighted engagement score (views=1, comments=3, posts=5, reactions=0.5) uses floating-point numbers. Ensure your database schema and calculations handle floating-point arithmetic correctly, especially considering potential for overflow or precision loss with many events.\\n\\n* **Last Hour Check vs. 24h Window:** The requirement of "at least one event in the last hour" might be too strict. Consider relaxing this or providing a justification.  A user might be considered inactive even with high engagement spread across the 24h period if they haven't interacted in the last hour.\\n\\n* **Test Cases:**  Add comprehensive unit and integration tests covering various scenarios:\\n    * Zero engagement in 24h.\\n    * High engagement spread across 24h (tests the decay function).\\n    * Engagement concentrated within the last hour.\\n    * Engagement concentrated only in the first 23h.\\n    * Edge cases with very high engagement scores (potential overflow).\\n\\n* **Code Clarity:**  Refactor the engagement calculation into a separate, well-documented function (`calculateEngagementScore()` for example) for readability and maintainability.\\n\\n* **Performance:**  The new calculation involves processing potentially a large number of user events over a 24-hour period.  Evaluate the performance impact, especially with a growing user base.  Consider optimizations such as caching or database indexing.\\n\\n\\n**Code Suggestions:**\\n\\n* **Add comments** explaining the purpose and parameters of the `calculateEngagementScore()` function.\\n* **Use constants** for weights (views=1, comments=3, etc.) instead of hardcoding them. This allows for easier modification.\\n* **Implement logging** to track the calculated engagement score for debugging and monitoring purposes.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:**  This PR needs substantial improvements before merging.  Addressing the above concerns is crucial for ensuring accuracy, maintainability, and performance.  Provide a revised PR with these changes implemented.
2	PR Title: Optimize search\\n\\nDescription:\\nMake search faster with caching or something similar. Keep correctness.	This PR lacks detail.  The "caching or something similar" is insufficient.  Please specify the caching mechanism used (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache, etc.), its eviction strategy, and any potential concurrency concerns.  Include benchmarks demonstrating performance improvements.  Furthermore, clearly articulate how correctness is maintained, particularly regarding cache invalidation and stale data.  Without this information, approval cannot be granted.	This PR needs significantly more detail.  The description is far too vague.  "Caching or something similar" is unacceptable.\\n\\n**Major Concerns:**\\n\\n* **Unspecified caching strategy:**  What type of caching?  (e.g., in-memory, Redis, memcached). What's the cache invalidation strategy?  How will you handle cache misses?  What's the estimated cache size and impact on memory usage?  Without this, the performance gains are purely speculative.  Propose a concrete caching algorithm and data structure.\\n* **Lack of benchmarking:**  "Make search faster" is subjective.  What's the *target* performance improvement?  How will you measure success?  You MUST include before-and-after benchmark results (with statistical significance) using a representative data set.  Include p50, p95, and max latencies.\\n* **Missing error handling details:** The response to empty/null queries is good, but what about other errors (e.g., database errors, network issues)?  How are these handled currently and how will the caching layer affect error handling?\\n* **Security risks (Admin wildcard access):** The admin wildcard access needs careful consideration. How is admin status verified?  What are the security implications of this wildcard access?  Are there safeguards against abuse?  Consider logging all wildcard searches performed by admins.\\n* **Test Coverage:** Add unit tests for the caching logic, including cache hits, misses, invalidation, and error scenarios.  Add integration tests to verify performance improvements under load.  Existing tests must be updated to account for the caching layer.\\n\\n\\n**Actionable Items:**\\n\\n* **Replace "caching or something similar" with a specific caching implementation.**  Provide code examples.\\n* **Add a detailed performance analysis section to the PR description.** Include charts showing before/after performance metrics. Describe the benchmarking methodology (data set size, load conditions, etc.).\\n* **Implement robust error handling.**  Document all error cases and their handling.\\n* **Address security concerns related to admin wildcard access.** Provide a detailed security analysis.\\n* **Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.**  Demonstrate 100% code coverage for new code and relevant changes to existing code.\\n* **Clearly define the success criteria.** What constitutes a "successful" optimization?  (e.g., p95 latency < X ms, error rate < Y%).\\n\\n\\nThis PR cannot be merged until these concerns are addressed.
3	PR Title: Improve error reporting\\n\\nDescription:\\nWe want clearer errors in the API responses. Make them more helpful.	The PR improves error reporting, but lacks specific examples of improvements.  Please add a section detailing the changes made and provide before/after examples of error responses for at least one endpoint.  Also, clarify if these changes impact existing clients, and if so, how the compatibility issue will be addressed.  Once these points are addressed, approval will be granted.	This PR needs significant improvement before merging.  The description is far too vague.  "More helpful" is subjective.  Concrete examples are needed.\\n\\n**Review Comments:**\\n\\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The description doesn't specify *which* API endpoints are affected, *what* the current error reporting looks like, and *what* the improved error reporting will look like.  Provide before-and-after examples for at least one endpoint.\\n\\n* **Insufficient Detail on Improvements:**  "More helpful" is insufficient.  Quantify the improvements.  For example:\\n    * "Reduced ambiguity in error messages by X%."\\n    * "Added specific error codes for Y and Z scenarios."\\n    * "Improved localization support for N languages."\\n\\n* **Missing Error Code Examples:**  The description mentions `error_code` but doesn't provide examples of the enum values.  Include a complete list of `error_code` values and their meanings in the PR description or a separate document.\\n\\n* **Localization Strategy:** How is localization handled?  What mechanism is used (e.g., gettext, a dedicated localization library)?  The description implies localization but doesn't detail the implementation.\\n\\n* **Error Handling Consistency:** Verify consistency across all affected endpoints.  Are all error responses formatted identically?  Are there any exceptions?\\n\\n* **Testing:**\\n    * **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to verify the new error handling logic for all possible error scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.\\n    * **Integration Tests:**  Add integration tests to ensure the correct error messages are returned in various scenarios from the API level.\\n    * **Localization Tests:** Add tests to verify the correct localization of error messages for all supported languages.\\n\\n\\n* **Code Suggestions (Example):**  If the current error response looks like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{ "error": "Something went wrong" }\\n```\\n\\nThe improved response should be far more specific.  For instance:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  "error_code": "INVALID_INPUT",\\n  "error_message": "The provided email address is invalid.",\\n  "details": {\\n    "field": "email",\\n    "constraints": ["format"]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis shows the type of detail that should be included.  The `details` field allows for more complex error situations to be clearly communicated.  Adapt this structure consistently across endpoints.\\n\\n\\n* **Risk Assessment:**  Changing error reporting impacts consumers of the API.  Thoroughly assess the potential breakage and consider a deprecation strategy if backward compatibility is severely compromised.  Document any breaking changes clearly.\\n\\nUntil these points are addressed, this PR cannot be merged.
4	PR Title: Add pagination to transactions API\\n\\nDescription:\\nAdd pagination to /api/transactions.	The PR adds pagination to `/api/transactions`, which is a necessary improvement for scalability.  However, please:\\n\\n1. **Specify the pagination parameters** used (e.g., `limit`, `offset`, `page`, `pageSize`).  Include this in both the code comments and API documentation.\\n\\n2. **Add thorough unit tests** covering edge cases (e.g., empty result set, invalid page numbers).\\n\\n3. **Document the response format** including the pagination metadata (total count, etc.).\\n\\n4. **Consider using a more robust pagination library** if one exists within the project, instead of implementing it manually.\\n\\n\\nOnce these points are addressed, I will approve.	## Review of "Add pagination to transactions API" PR\\n\\nOverall, the approach seems sound, but several clarifications and improvements are needed.\\n\\n**Specific Comments:**\\n\\n* **Error Handling:**  Add comprehensive error handling.  What happens if `limit` is not an integer, is negative, or exceeds 200?  What happens if an invalid `order` value is provided (e.g., "foobar")?  Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request) with clear error messages in the response body.  Consider using a standardized error format (e.g., JSON API).\\n\\n* **Cursor Handling:**  The PR description mentions `next_cursor`.  The implementation needs to be carefully reviewed.  Ensure the cursor is robust and avoids issues with data updates or concurrency.  Add tests to cover edge cases (e.g., empty result set, last page, cursor manipulation).\\n\\n* **Input Validation:**  Explicitly validate all input parameters (`limit`, `order`, `created_at`, `amount`, `next_cursor`). Use a validation library to ensure robustness and avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\n* **Testing:**  Add unit and integration tests to cover:\\n    * Valid pagination with different `limit` values.\\n    * Handling of edge cases (empty dataset, limit exceeding maximum, invalid inputs).\\n    * Correct sorting by `created_at` and `amount` with ascending and descending orders, including tie-breaks.\\n    * Correct cursor generation and handling.\\n    * Error handling scenarios (invalid inputs, database errors).\\n\\n* **Documentation:** Update API documentation to clearly specify the pagination parameters (`limit`, `next_cursor`, `order`, `created_at`, `amount`), their allowed values, and the expected response format. Include example requests and responses.\\n\\n* **Security:**  Consider potential security risks related to pagination, especially if the `next_cursor` is predictable or easily manipulated.  If necessary, add measures to prevent abuse or data leakage (e.g., rate limiting).\\n\\n* **Code Style:** Ensure consistent code style and formatting throughout the changes. Follow existing project conventions.\\n\\n* **Performance:** Analyze the performance impact of pagination, especially for large datasets. Consider adding indexes to the database to optimize query performance.\\n\\n* **Code Example (Illustrative):**  Show how to handle the `next_cursor` in the API response. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  "transactions": [ /* ... transaction data ... */ ],\\n  "next_cursor": "some_cursor_value" \\n}\\n```\\n\\n* **Alternative Pagination:** Explore if using page numbers instead of a cursor might be simpler (although cursors are generally better for large datasets).  This needs to be a design decision.\\n\\n\\nAddressing these points will significantly improve the quality, robustness, and security of the changes.
5	PR Title: Rate limiter for login\\n\\nDescription:\\nAdd a rate limiter to login to prevent abuse.	Overall, the rate limiter addition is a welcome improvement for security.  However, please:\\n\\n* **Specify the rate limit algorithm and parameters:**  Document the chosen algorithm (e.g., sliding window, token bucket) and the configured rate (e.g., 5 attempts per minute).\\n* **Clarify handling of failures:** How are users notified of rate limiting?  What happens if the rate limiter itself fails?  Include robust error handling.\\n* **Consider logging:** Add logging to track rate limit hits and potential abuse.\\n* **Unit tests:** Ensure comprehensive unit tests cover various scenarios, including exceeding the rate limit and successful logins.\\n\\nAddress these points before merging.	## Review Comments: Rate Limiter for Login\\n\\nThis PR addresses a crucial security concern. However, several clarifications and improvements are needed:\\n\\n\\n**Overall Concerns:**\\n\\n* **Missing Implementation Details:** The description lacks specifics on the *implementation* of the rate limiter.  Which library/algorithm is used? Is it in-memory, Redis-based, or another solution?  This significantly impacts scalability and maintainability.  The code itself needs thorough review.\\n* **Error Handling & User Experience:** How are rate limit breaches communicated to the user?  Is there clear, user-friendly messaging for both soft (CAPTCHA) and hard lockouts?  Consider adding unit tests for these error messages.\\n* **Security Considerations:**  Is the IP address the sole identifier?  Consider using a more robust approach that accounts for proxies and VPNs.  How are CAPTCHAs handled securely?  Are they properly integrated with a reliable CAPTCHA service, preventing abuse of the CAPTCHA itself?\\n* **Testability:**  The implementation needs comprehensive unit and integration tests.  Test cases should cover:\\n    * Successful logins.\\n    * Various failure scenarios (exceeding limits, legitimate users within limits).\\n    * Soft and hard lockouts.\\n    * Resetting the limiter after successful login.\\n    * Behavior with different IP addresses and accounts.\\n\\n\\n**Specific Code Suggestions (Assuming a Redis-based implementation):**\\n\\n* **Rate Limiter Library:**  Specify the chosen rate-limiting library (e.g., `golang.org/x/time/rate` if using Go, similar libraries for other languages).  This improves readability and maintainability.\\n* **Redis Keys:**  Show the exact Redis key structure used (e.g., `login:attempts:{ip}:{account}`).  This is crucial for understanding the implementation and debugging.\\n* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for Redis interactions (network errors, timeouts).\\n* **Concurrency:**  If using multiple goroutines/threads, ensure thread safety when accessing and updating the rate limiter data structure.\\n* **Logging:**  Add detailed logging to track login attempts, successful logins, and rate limit hits.  This is invaluable for monitoring and debugging.\\n\\n\\n**Tests to Add:**\\n\\n* **Unit tests:**  For the rate limiting logic itself (independent of Redis).\\n* **Integration tests:**  End-to-end tests that simulate user logins and verify the rate limiting behavior with a real Redis instance.\\n* **Stress tests:**  To determine the system's resilience under heavy load.\\n\\n\\n**Concrete Code Changes (Example - adapt to your specific code):**\\n\\n```go\\n// Instead of:\\nif attempts > 5 {\\n    // ...hard lockout...\\n}\\n\\n// Consider:\\nlimiter := rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(15*time.Minute), 5)\\nif !limiter.Allow() {\\n    // ...handle rate limit exceedance...\\n}\\n\\n// ...Add logging for every login attempt...\\n```\\n\\nBefore merging, address these concerns thoroughly. The implementation needs a significant review to ensure security, robustness, and scalability.  The lack of detail in the current PR makes a complete evaluation impossible.
6	PR Title: Export report to CSV\\n\\nDescription:\\nLet users export the sales report to CSV.	This PR provides a much-needed feature.  The implementation should include unit tests covering edge cases (e.g., empty report, large datasets).  Additionally, please ensure the generated CSV adheres to RFC 4180 and handles special characters appropriately.  Consider adding a progress indicator for large reports.  Approved pending these minor improvements.	## Review Comments: Export Report to CSV PR\\n\\nThis PR introduces a valuable feature, but requires some improvements before merging.\\n\\n**Functionality & Design:**\\n\\n* **Error Handling:**  The PR needs robust error handling.  What happens if S3 is unavailable?  What error messages are presented to the user? Add logging for both successful exports and failures.  Consider using a retry mechanism for transient S3 errors.\\n* **Filename collisions:**  The filename scheme doesn't account for potential collisions if multiple reports are generated within the same minute. Consider adding a UUID or incrementing counter to ensure uniqueness.\\n* **Security:** Verify the signed URL generation is correctly implemented and adheres to best security practices.  The 15-minute TTL is reasonable, but consider adding configuration options to allow for adjustments.  Review the permissions of the S3 bucket and ensure that only authorized users can access the reports.\\n* **7-day retention:** Implement automatic cleanup of old files. This should be a background task or scheduled job, not blocking the export operation.  Consider adding monitoring to ensure the cleanup is functioning correctly.\\n* **User Interface:** The PR description omits details about how users initiate the export.  Are there any UI changes?  Document this clearly.  Consider adding feedback mechanisms (e.g., progress bar, success/failure notification) to improve the user experience.\\n* **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests covering:\\n    * Successful export to S3.\\n    * Handling of S3 errors (e.g., network issues, bucket not found).\\n    * Filename generation (including collision avoidance).\\n    * Signed URL generation and expiry.\\n    * File format validation (UTF-8, RFC4180 compliance).\\n    * 7-day retention (verify cleanup).\\n    * UI interactions (if applicable).\\n\\n\\n**Code Suggestions:**\\n\\n* **Configuration:** Extract S3 bucket name, retention period, and TTL into configuration settings, rather than hardcoding them. This improves maintainability and allows for easy adjustments.\\n* **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging throughout the export process, including timestamps, user IDs, filenames, and any errors encountered.  Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) for easier analysis.\\n* **Code Style:**  Ensure consistent code style and formatting throughout the PR.  Adhere to project standards (if any).\\n\\n\\n**Before merging:**\\n\\n* Address all the comments above.\\n* Provide updated documentation reflecting the changes.\\n* Include comprehensive test coverage.\\n\\nThis PR is a significant improvement, but these changes are needed to ensure its reliability, security, and maintainability.
7	PR Title: Image upload validation\\n\\nDescription:\\nAdd validation for uploaded images.	This PR needs more detail.  The description is insufficient.  Please specify:\\n\\n* **Which types of validation are included?** (e.g., file type, file size, dimensions, MIME type)\\n* **What happens when validation fails?** (e.g., error message, user feedback)\\n* **Are unit tests included?**  These are crucial for image validation.\\n* **Please provide examples of the error handling.**\\n\\nOnce these points are addressed, I can proceed with a thorough review.	## Review Comments: Image Upload Validation PR\\n\\nThis PR addresses a crucial security and usability aspect. However, several clarifications and improvements are needed.\\n\\n**Code Changes & Improvements:**\\n\\n* **Explicit File Size Check:**  The code should explicitly check the file size *before* attempting to process the image.  Avoid potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities by rejecting oversized files immediately.  Show a clear error message to the user indicating the maximum allowed size (5MB).  Example: `if (fileSize > 5 * 1024 * 1024) { throw new Error("Image exceeds maximum size (5MB)."); }`\\n* **MIME Type Validation:**  Don't rely solely on file extensions.  Validate the MIME type using `content-type` header (if available) and potentially libraries like `file-type` to verify the actual file format. This prevents malicious uploads disguised with incorrect extensions.\\n* **Dimension Check:** Add explicit checks for minimum dimensions (256x256).  Use a suitable image processing library (e.g., Sharp, ImageMagick) to efficiently get dimensions without fully loading the image into memory.  Reject images that don't meet the minimum size.\\n* **Metadata Stripping:**  Specify the exact library and method used for metadata stripping.  Document any potential errors or exceptions that might occur during this process and how they are handled (e.g., logging, fallback).  Consider adding logging to track successful and unsuccessful metadata stripping.\\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for all validation steps.  Catch potential exceptions (e.g., `IOException`,  `ImageProcessingException`) and provide informative error messages to the user and/or logs.\\n* **Security Considerations (SVG):**  Clearly explain *why* SVG is rejected. Is it due to potential XSS vulnerabilities (embedded scripts)?  Document this decision. Consider adding a whitelist of allowed MIME types for better security and maintainability.\\n\\n\\n**Testing:**\\n\\n* **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests covering all validation scenarios: valid images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, different sizes), invalid images (too large, wrong format, incorrect dimensions, corrupted files), and edge cases (empty file, null file).\\n* **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire image upload flow, including the validation steps, within an integrated environment.  Verify that error messages are displayed correctly to the user.\\n* **Security Tests:** Perform security scans (e.g., static analysis, penetration testing) to identify potential vulnerabilities.\\n\\n\\n**Risks:**\\n\\n* **Performance:**  Image processing can be resource-intensive.  Ensure the validation process is optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks, particularly under high load. Consider asynchronous processing.\\n* **Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling can lead to application crashes or security vulnerabilities.\\n\\n\\n**Concrete Code Example (Illustrative):**\\n\\n```javascript\\n//Illustrative example - adapt to your specific framework and libraries\\nconst allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];\\nif (!allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {\\n    throw new Error('Invalid image format');\\n}\\n\\n// ... (file size check, dimension check using image processing library)...\\n```\\n\\n\\nThis review focuses on ensuring the code is robust, secure, and well-tested.  Addressing these points will significantly improve the PR's quality.
8	PR Title: Update password requirements\\n\\nDescription:\\nMake passwords simpler: only letters. Examples: - "P@ssw0rd!" (expected: valid)	Reject.  The proposed change weakens password security significantly by removing complexity requirements (numbers, symbols).  This is a major security risk and directly contradicts best practices.  The example provided ("P@ssw0rd!") is *not* a simple password consisting only of letters, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the requirements themselves.  The PR needs substantial revision to reflect a robust password policy, or be withdrawn.	This PR is unclear and contradictory. The title, description, and Q&A conflict on password requirements.  Significant rework is needed.\\n\\n**Major Issues:**\\n\\n* **Contradictory Requirements:** The description states "Make passwords simpler: only letters," while Q&A states "Minimum length = 12 characters; allow any printable characters."  These are diametrically opposed.  Clarify the *actual* intended password policy.\\n* **Missing Implementation Details:**  The description mentions "require length and entropy checks" and "Block top N breached/common passwords," but provides no implementation details.  Where is this logic implemented? How are breached passwords identified?  How is entropy calculated? What is "N"?\\n* **Security Risks:**  Allowing "any printable characters" without robust entropy checks is highly insecure.  This makes brute-force attacks significantly easier.  12 characters is a minimum, but not sufficient on its own.\\n* **Missing Test Cases:**  Add unit tests covering:\\n    * Valid passwords (various lengths and character sets, if allowed).\\n    * Invalid passwords (too short, only letters, breached passwords, etc.).\\n    * Edge cases (passwords with leading/trailing whitespace, special characters beyond the allowed set).\\n\\n**Actionable Suggestions:**\\n\\n* **Define Clear Password Policy:**  First, *clearly define* the final password policy in a single, unambiguous statement (e.g., "Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.  Passwords from a list of common/breached passwords will be rejected").\\n* **Implement and Document the Policy:**  Implement the chosen policy in code, ensuring it's robust and well-documented.\\n* **Show Code Changes for Length and Entropy Checks:**  Provide the specific code changes implementing length and entropy checks. Show where the list of breached passwords is loaded and how it's used for comparison. Consider using a well-established password strength library if available.\\n* **Implement Password Blacklist:**  Show how the top N breached/common passwords are handled. Consider using a reputable source for this list and regularly updating it.\\n* **Address Security Concerns:**  Re-evaluate the security implications of the chosen policy.  If using a less strict policy, clearly articulate and justify the reduced security.\\n* **Improve PR Description:**  Rewrite the PR description to accurately reflect the implemented policy and address all the above points.\\n\\n**Code Suggestions (Example):**\\n\\nAssume a function `isValidPassword(password)` needs to be implemented:\\n\\n```python\\nimport re\\n\\nBREACHED_PASSWORDS = ["password123", "12345678", ...] # Load from a file or database\\n\\ndef isValidPassword(password):\\n    if len(password) < 12:\\n        return False\\n    if re.fullmatch("[a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+-=]+", password) is None: #Example regex, adjust as needed\\n        return False\\n    if password in BREACHED_PASSWORDS:\\n        return False\\n    # Add entropy check here (e.g., using a library or custom calculation)\\n    return True\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis is a basic example, and the complexity will depend on your chosen policy.  Remember to thoroughly test all aspects of the implementation.
9	PR Title: Normalize timezones\\n\\nDescription:\\nStore all times in local timezone. Comments elsewhere: - "All backend times must be UTC."	This PR contradicts established backend requirements (all times must be UTC).  Reject.  Please clarify the discrepancy and propose a solution consistent with UTC storage.  If a change in backend requirements is needed, open a separate issue to discuss it before proceeding.	This PR introduces significant risk and needs substantial rework before merging.  The stated goal and implementation are contradictory.\\n\\n**Major Concerns:**\\n\\n* **Contradictory Goals:** The PR description claims to store all times in *local* timezone, while the clarifying answer states the goal is to store all times in *UTC*.  This is a fundamental conflict.  Choose one approach.  Storing in local timezones is strongly discouraged due to the inherent problems with DST and timezone changes.  UTC is the standard for data persistence.\\n\\n* **Missing Migration Details:**  A "one-time script" for backfilling legacy fields is insufficient detail.  Provide the script itself for review, including error handling, rollback strategy, and confirmation of data integrity post-migration.  Consider the performance impact of this migration on a production database.\\n\\n* **Insufficient Testing:**  Add comprehensive tests covering:\\n    * **Data Integrity:** Verify that all existing data is correctly migrated and that new data is stored and retrieved correctly in UTC.\\n    * **Edge Cases:** Test around DST transitions, leap seconds, and edge cases with different timezones.\\n    * **Client-Side Handling:**  Ensure client-side code correctly handles the conversion from UTC to local time for display.  This requires updating relevant UI components and potentially adding timezone selection features.\\n    * **Regression Tests:**  Add tests to verify existing functionality isn't broken.\\n\\n* **Ambiguous Client-Side Handling:**  The description mentions clients displaying in local TZ. How is this conversion handled? Is there client-side code to adjust this for each user's timezone? This needs to be made explicit.  Consider using a standardized library for timezone handling to improve accuracy and consistency.\\n\\n**Code Suggestions (Assuming UTC is the chosen standard):**\\n\\n* **Explicit Type Conversions:** Add explicit type conversions in all database interactions to ensure consistency between the application and database timezones (e.g., using a dedicated library like `pytz` in Python or similar in other languages).  Clearly document the timezone of each data field.\\n* **Logging:** Add detailed logging to track timezone conversions during the migration process and beyond for debugging purposes.\\n* **Review Database Schema:** Verify the database schema is updated correctly to reflect the change (e.g., using appropriate data types and potentially adding a timezone column if needed).\\n\\n\\n**Before Merging:**\\n\\n* Provide the complete migration script.\\n* Address all the testing requirements listed above.\\n* Clearly define the client-side timezone handling mechanism.\\n* Resolve the conflicting statements about local vs. UTC storage. Choose a single, consistent strategy.\\n\\n\\nThis PR needs significant revision before it's ready for merging. The current state is too risky and lacks essential details.
10	PR Title: Remove deprecated endpoint\\n\\nDescription:\\nRemove GET /v1/items. Changelog in PR body: - "Add GET /v1/items docs."	This PR is incomplete.  The description claims to remove a deprecated endpoint but the title and changelog entry conflict; the changelog indicates *adding* documentation for the endpoint, not removing it.  Please clarify the intent and update the description and changelog to accurately reflect the changes.  If the endpoint is being removed, ensure all references and dependencies are handled. If it's not, correct the changelog.  Reject until clarified.	This PR needs significant improvement before merging.\\n\\n* **PR Title and Description are insufficient:** The title should clearly state what's being removed and the replacement.  Example: "Remove Deprecated `/v1/items` Endpoint; Replace with `/v2/items`". The description should summarize the changes concisely, including the deprecation timeline (if any). The changelog entry is included in the description, which is unconventional; it should be in a separate section.\\n\\n\\n* **Changelog needs significant expansion:** The provided changelog entry is inadequate. It needs:\\n    * **Clear "Removed" entry:**  "Removed `/v1/items` endpoint (HTTP 410 Gone)."\\n    * **Detailed "Added/Changed" entry for `/v2/items`:** Include features (pagination, filtering options), example requests (showing pagination and filters), and a clear explanation of the benefits of the new endpoint.\\n    * **Migration Guide:**  Provide explicit steps for developers to migrate from `/v1/items` to `/v2/items`,  including code examples illustrating the changes needed.  Consider providing a migration script or tool if the changes are complex.\\n\\n\\n* **Missing Tests:**  Add tests to verify:\\n    * `/v1/items` returns a 410 Gone status code.\\n    * `/v2/items` functions correctly (including pagination and filtering).\\n    * Existing clients using `/v1/items` (if any) are appropriately addressed (e.g., using monitoring to detect errors after deployment).\\n\\n\\n* **Risk Assessment:** What is the impact of removing this endpoint?  Are there any clients still actively using `/v1/items`? How will you address potential disruption? A clear mitigation plan must be included.  This plan might involve monitoring for errors after deployment, or a staged rollout.\\n\\n\\n* **Code Review:**  Review the actual code changes for clarity, efficiency and adherence to coding standards.  Look for unnecessary complexity and potential performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n\\n* **Documentation Update:** Update API documentation to reflect the removal of `/v1/items` and the addition of `/v2/items`.\\n\\n\\n* **Deployment Plan:** Include a detailed deployment plan to minimize downtime and disruption.  Consider using feature flags for a controlled rollout.\\n\\n\\nBefore merging, address all these points. The current PR is not ready for production.
11	PR Title: Session timeout policy\\n\\nDescription:\\nIntroduce automatic logout after inactivity. Default timeout is not specified. Apply this to all user roles.	This PR needs significant improvement before merging.  The lack of a default timeout value is a major concern and introduces ambiguity.  Specify a reasonable default timeout and justify its selection.  Additionally, consider role-based configuration; a single timeout for all users may not be appropriate.  Finally, include clear testing demonstrating the functionality and edge cases (e.g., handling concurrent requests during timeout).	## Review Comments: Session Timeout Policy PR\\n\\nThis PR needs significant improvements before merging.  The description is inconsistent with the Q&A, and crucial details are missing.\\n\\n**Major Concerns:**\\n\\n* **Inconsistent Timeouts:** The description states "Default timeout is not specified," while Q&A specifies 30 minutes.  Choose one and update consistently.  The Q&A also introduces role-based timeouts (15 minutes for admins), which needs to be clearly reflected in the description and code.\\n* **Missing Default Timeout Definition:** The code must clearly define the default timeout (30 minutes) and how it's overridden for different roles (admins, service accounts).  Show code examples.\\n* **Warning Modal Implementation:**  The description mentions a warning modal.  The PR should include details on its implementation (UX design, accessibility considerations, cancelability). Code example required.\\n* **Service Account Handling:**  The Q&A mentions exempting service accounts but requiring short-lived tokens with refresh. This needs a detailed explanation and code examples.  How is "short-lived" defined? What's the refresh mechanism?  What happens if refresh fails?\\n* **Configuration:** The timeout values (30 minutes, 15 minutes) should ideally be configurable, not hardcoded.  Consider adding a configuration mechanism (e.g., environment variables, config file).\\n* **Testing:**  Add comprehensive tests to cover:\\n    * Different user roles logging out after the correct timeout periods.\\n    * The warning modal functionality (display, timing, cancelability).\\n    * Service account token refresh success and failure scenarios.\\n    * Edge cases (e.g., user actively interacting just before timeout, multiple tabs).\\n\\n**Code Suggestions:**\\n\\n* **Use a consistent time unit:** Use either seconds or milliseconds consistently throughout the code instead of mixing minutes and unspecified units.\\n* **Centralized Timeout Configuration:** Create a central configuration file or mechanism to manage session timeouts for different roles.  Example:\\n```json\\n{\\n  "defaultTimeout": 1800, // seconds\\n  "adminTimeout": 900,   // seconds\\n  "serviceAccountTimeout": 60 //seconds\\n}\\n```\\n* **Logging:** Add comprehensive logging to track session timeouts, warnings, and refresh attempts.\\n\\n**Actionable Items:**\\n\\n1. **Update PR description:**  Clearly state the default and role-specific timeouts.\\n2. **Implement warning modal:** Provide the code and UX design.\\n3. **Implement role-based timeouts:** Show how the code handles different roles and their associated timeouts.\\n4. **Implement service account handling:** Detail the short-lived token and refresh mechanism, including error handling.\\n5. **Add configuration:** Make timeout values configurable.\\n6. **Add comprehensive tests:** Cover all aspects of the functionality.\\n\\n\\nThis PR is currently not ready for merge due to the missing information and lack of testing.  Please address the above concerns before resubmitting.
