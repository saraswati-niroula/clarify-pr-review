What constitutes a \"score\"? Is it the count of unique elements? The sum of unique elements? Something else?  The code is needed to understand and review the logic.  Provide a clear mathematical formula or pseudocode describing the score calculation.\n\n* **Canonicalization Ambiguity:**  A1 mentions \"trim/normalize casing and numeric type\".  This is vague. Provide specific examples.  What constitutes \"trim\"? (leading/trailing whitespace only?  Other characters?)  How is casing normalized (lowercase?  uppercase?)? What about other data types (dates, booleans)? How is canonicalization implemented?  The code needs to clearly show this process.\n\n* **Type Stability and -0 Handling:** A2 mentions type-stable comparisons for -0 and 0. This is crucial.  The reviewer needs to see explicit code handling this (e.g., using `math.isclose` or similar for floating-point comparisons).  Demonstrate that the code correctly handles  `-0.0`, `0.0`, `0`, and other numeric types consistently.\n\n* **Missing Error Handling:** What happens with invalid input (e.g., non-list input, lists containing non-comparable types)? Add robust error handling and appropriate logging/exceptions.\n\n* **Lack of Tests:**  No mention of tests.  This is unacceptable.  Add comprehensive unit tests covering:\n    * Empty lists.\n    * Lists with only unique elements.\n    * Lists with duplicate elements (before and after canonicalization).\n    * Lists containing negative numbers, zero, and different numeric types.\n    * Lists containing strings with leading/trailing whitespace and mixed casing.\n    * Lists with invalid input types (raise appropriate exceptions).\n    * Edge cases related to type stability and -0 handling.\n\n\n**Specific Code Suggestions:**\n\n* **Introduce a `canonicalize` function:**  Extract the canonicalization logic into a separate, well-tested function for better readability and maintainability.  Document the function clearly, including examples.\n\n* **Use a `collections.Counter`:** This will efficiently count unique elements after canonicalization.\n\n* **Add comments:**  Explain each step of the scoring algorithm in detail.\n\n* **Improve variable names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., instead of  `list`, use `input_list`, `unique_elements`, `score`).\n\n\n**Example Code Snippet (Illustrative - replace with actual implementation):**\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef canonicalize(item):\n    \"\"\"Canonicalizes an item by trimming whitespace, lowercasing strings, and handling numeric types.\"\"\"\n    if isinstance(item, str):\n        return item.strip().lower()  #Example - needs refinement per A1\n    elif isinstance(item, (int, float)):\n        return 0.0 if math.isclose(item, 0.0) else item #Example - address -0.0\n    else:  # Add handling for other types or raise an exception\n        raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported type: {type(item)}\")\n\ndef calculate_score(input_list):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the score of a list (replace with actual scoring logic).\"\"\"\n    unique_elements = Counter(map(canonicalize, input_list))\n    # ... scoring logic based on unique_elements ...\n    return score\n\n```\n\n\nThis PR needs substantial rework before merging.

While the intent is clear, several aspects require clarification and improvement.\n\n\n**Concerns & Action Items:**\n\n* **Missing Decay Function:**  A2 mentions a \"decay\" function for engagement.  The PR must explicitly define this function (e.g., exponential decay, half-life).  Include the formula and implementation in the code.  Without this, the \"weighted engagement\" calculation is incomplete.\n\n* **Threshold Justification:** The threshold of ≥ 3 is arbitrary.  Provide a rationale for choosing this value, ideally backed by data or user research. Consider adding a configurable threshold to allow for future adjustments.\n\n* **Data Type and Overflow:**  The weighted engagement score (views=1, comments=3, posts=5, reactions=0.5) uses floating-point numbers. Ensure your database schema and calculations handle floating-point arithmetic correctly, especially considering potential for overflow or precision loss with many events.\n\n* **Last Hour Check vs. 24h Window:** The requirement of \"at least one event in the last hour\" might be too strict. Consider relaxing this or providing a justification.  A user might be considered inactive even with high engagement spread across the 24h period if they haven't interacted in the last hour.\n\n* **Test Cases:**  Add comprehensive unit and integration tests covering various scenarios:\n    * Zero engagement in 24h.\n    * High engagement spread across 24h (tests the decay function).\n    * Engagement concentrated within the last hour.\n    * Engagement concentrated only in the first 23h.\n    * Edge cases with very high engagement scores (potential overflow).\n\n* **Code Clarity:**  Refactor the engagement calculation into a separate, well-documented function (`calculateEngagementScore()` for example) for readability and maintainability.\n\n* **Performance:**  The new calculation involves processing potentially a large number of user events over a 24-hour period.  Evaluate the performance impact, especially with a growing user base.  Consider optimizations such as caching or database indexing.\n\n\n**Code Suggestions:**\n\n* **Add comments** explaining the purpose and parameters of the `calculateEngagementScore()` function.\n* **Use constants** for weights (views=1, comments=3, etc.) instead of hardcoding them. This allows for easier modification.\n* **Implement logging** to track the calculated engagement score for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n\n\n**Overall:**  This PR needs substantial improvements before merging.  Addressing the above concerns is crucial for ensuring accuracy, maintainability, and performance.  Provide a revised PR with these changes implemented."}

Without this, the performance gains are purely speculative.  Propose a concrete caching algorithm and data structure.\n* **Lack of benchmarking:**  \"Make search faster\" is subjective.  What's the *target* performance improvement?  How will you measure success?  You MUST include before-and-after benchmark results (with statistical significance) using a representative data set.  Include p50, p95, and max latencies.\n* **Missing error handling details:** The response to empty/null queries is good, but what about other errors (e.g., database errors, network issues)?  How are these handled currently and how will the caching layer affect error handling?\n* **Security risks (Admin wildcard access):** The admin wildcard access needs careful consideration. How is admin status verified?  What are the security implications of this wildcard access?  Are there safeguards against abuse?  Consider logging all wildcard searches performed by admins.\n* **Test Coverage:** Add unit tests for the caching logic, including cache hits, misses, invalidation, and error scenarios.

However, several clarifications and improvements are needed.\n\n**Code Changes & Improvements:**\n\n* **Explicit File Size Check:**  The code should explicitly check the file size *before* attempting to process the image.  Avoid potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities by rejecting oversized files immediately.  Show a clear error message to the user indicating the maximum allowed size (5MB).  Example: `if (fileSize > 5 * 1024 * 1024) { throw new Error(\"Image exceeds maximum size (5MB).\"); }`\n* **MIME Type Validation:**  Don't rely solely on file extensions.  Validate the MIME type using `content-type` header (if available) and potentially libraries like `file-type` to verify the actual file format. This prevents malicious uploads disguised with incorrect extensions.\n* **Dimension Check:** Add explicit checks for minimum dimensions (256x256).  Use a suitable image processing library (e.g., Sharp, ImageMagick) to efficiently get dimensions without fully loading the image into memory.  Reject images that don't meet the minimum size.\n* **Metadata Stripping:**  Specify the exact library and method used for metadata stripping.  Document any potential errors or exceptions that might occur during this process and how they are handled (e.g., logging, fallback).  Consider adding logging to track successful and unsuccessful metadata stripping.\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for all validation steps.  Catch potential exceptions (e.g., `IOException`,  `ImageProcessingException`) and provide informative error messages to the user and/or logs.\n* **Security Considerations (SVG):**  Clearly explain *why* SVG is rejected. Is it due to potential XSS vulnerabilities (embedded scripts)?  Document this decision. Consider adding a whitelist of allowed MIME types for better security and maintainability.\n\n\n**Testing:**\n\n* **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests covering all validation scenarios: valid images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, different sizes), invalid images (too large, wrong format, incorrect dimensions, corrupted files), and edge cases (empty file, null file).\n* **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire image upload flow, including the validation steps, within an integrated environment.  Verify that error messages are displayed correctly to the user.\n* **Security Tests:** Perform security scans (e.g., static analysis, penetration testing) to identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **Performance:**  Image processing can be resource-intensive.  Ensure the validation process is optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks, particularly under high load. Consider asynchronous processing.\n* **Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling can lead to application crashes or security vulnerabilities.\n\n\n**Concrete Code Example (Illustrative):**\n\n```javascript\n//Illustrative example - adapt to your specific framework and libraries\nconst allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];\nif (!allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid image format');\n}\n\n// ...

Provide the script itself for review, including error handling, rollback strategy, and confirmation of data integrity post-migration.  Consider the performance impact of this migration on a production database.\n\n* **Insufficient Testing:**  Add comprehensive tests covering:\n    * **Data Integrity:** Verify that all existing data is correctly migrated and that new data is stored and retrieved correctly in UTC.\n    * **Edge Cases:** Test around DST transitions, leap seconds, and edge cases with different timezones.\n    * **Client-Side Handling:**  Ensure client-side code correctly handles the conversion from UTC to local time for display.  This requires updating relevant UI components and potentially adding timezone selection features.\n    * **Regression Tests:**  Add tests to verify existing functionality isn't broken.\n\n* **Ambiguous Client-Side Handling:**  The description mentions clients displaying in local TZ. How is this conversion handled? Is there client-side code to adjust this for each user's timezone? This needs to be made explicit.  Consider using a standardized library for timezone handling to improve accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Code Suggestions (Assuming UTC is the chosen standard):**\n\n* **Explicit Type Conversions:** Add explicit type conversions in all database interactions to ensure consistency between the application and database timezones (e.g., using a dedicated library like `pytz` in Python or similar in other languages).  Clearly document the timezone of each data field.\n* **Logging:** Add detailed logging to track timezone conversions during the migration process and beyond for debugging purposes.\n* **Review Database Schema:** Verify the database schema is updated correctly to reflect the change (e.g., using appropriate data types and potentially adding a timezone column if needed).\n\n\n**Before Merging:**\n\n* Provide the complete migration script.\n* Address all the testing requirements listed above.\n* Clearly define the client-side timezone handling mechanism.\n* Resolve the conflicting statements about local vs. UTC storage. Choose a single, consistent strategy.\n\n\nThis PR needs significant revision before it's ready for merging. The current state is too risky and lacks essential details."}

Example: \"Remove Deprecated `/v1/items` Endpoint; Replace with `/v2/items`\". The description should summarize the changes concisely, including the deprecation timeline (if any). The changelog entry is included in the description, which is unconventional; it should be in a separate section.\n\n\n* **Changelog needs significant expansion:** The provided changelog entry is inadequate.

The description is inconsistent with the Q&A, and crucial details are missing.\n\n**Major Concerns:**\n\n* **Inconsistent Timeouts:** The description states \"Default timeout is not specified,\" while Q&A specifies 30 minutes.  Choose one and update consistently.  The Q&A also introduces role-based timeouts (15 minutes for admins), which needs to be clearly reflected in the description and code.\n* **Missing Default Timeout Definition:** The code must clearly define the default timeout (30 minutes) and how it's overridden for different roles (admins, service accounts).  Show code examples.\n* **Warning Modal Implementation:**  The description mentions a warning modal.  The PR should include details on its implementation (UX design, accessibility considerations, cancelability). Code example required.\n* **Service Account Handling:**  The Q&A mentions exempting service accounts but requiring short-lived tokens with refresh. This needs a detailed explanation and code examples.  How is \"short-lived\" defined? What's the refresh mechanism?  What happens if refresh fails?\n* **Configuration:** The timeout values (30 minutes, 15 minutes) should ideally be configurable, not hardcoded.  Consider adding a configuration mechanism (e.g., environment variables, config file).\n* **Testing:**  Add comprehensive tests to cover:\n    * Different user roles logging out after the correct timeout periods.\n    * The warning modal functionality (display, timing, cancelability).\n    * Service account token refresh success and failure scenarios.\n    * Edge cases (e.g., user actively interacting just before timeout, multiple tabs).\n\n**Code Suggestions:**\n\n* **Use a consistent time unit:** Use either seconds or milliseconds consistently throughout the code instead of mixing minutes and unspecified units.\n* **Centralized Timeout Configuration:** Create a central configuration file or mechanism to manage session timeouts for different roles.  Example:\n```json\n{\n  \"defaultTimeout\": 1800, // seconds\n  \"adminTimeout\": 900,   // seconds\n  \"serviceAccountTimeout\": 60 //seconds\n}\n```\n* **Logging:** Add comprehensive logging to track session timeouts, warnings, and refresh attempts.\n\n**Actionable Items:**\n\n1. **Update PR description:**  Clearly state the default and role-specific timeouts.\n2. **Implement warning modal:** Provide the code and UX design.\n3. **Implement role-based timeouts:** Show how the code handles different roles and their associated timeouts.\n4. **Implement service account handling:** Detail the short-lived token and refresh mechanism, including error handling.\n5. **Add configuration:** Make timeout values configurable.\n6. **Add comprehensive tests:** Cover all aspects of the functionality.\n\n\nThis PR is currently not ready for merge due to the missing information and lack of testing.  Please address the above concerns before resubmitting."}
